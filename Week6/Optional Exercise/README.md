# Optional exercise on Regularized Linear Regression and Bias-Variance
In the [instructions](https://github.com/AnnickWONG/Standford_machine_learning/blob/main/Week6/ex5-octave/ex5.pdf) of Programming Excercise 5, there are 3 optional exercises:
* 3.2: Adjusting the regularization parameter
* 3.4: Computing test set error
* 3.5: Plotting learningcurves with randomly selected examples

The script ***OptionalEx.m*** provide the solution for these optional exercises. This script use the functions that are built in the previous exercise, so it should be place in the same path as the script ***ex5.m***.

## 3.2 Adjusting the regularization parameter
In this section, we will observe how the regularization parameter (λ) affects the bias-variance of regularized polynomial regression. 

Using λ = 0, 1, 100, we will obtain the result figure like:
